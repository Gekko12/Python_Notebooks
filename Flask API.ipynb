The status value will override the status code and headers can be a list or dictionary of additional header values.\n",

    "* Pickling and marshalling is almost same in python. It is used in serializing and deserializing a Python object structure or in other words the process of converting a Python object into a byte stream.\n",
    "* Flask-restful also comes with methods like `marshal`, `marshal_with` and `marshal_with_field`, which are useful for filtering the response data from return values of methods.\n",
    "* `marshal` method of Flask-RESTful package provides the ability to filter data of specified fields in a desired format.\n",
    "* `marshal` method takes either a dictionary, list, or an object as input of data and a dictionary of fields, to be available in output, and filters the data based on those fields.\n",
    "* In addition to marshal method, you can also use `marshal_with` decorator for marshalling the return object of a method with specified data fields.\n",
