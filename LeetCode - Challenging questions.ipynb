    "## 1143. Longest Common Subsequence\n",
    "Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence. If there is no common subsequence, return 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, \"ace\" is a subsequence of \"abcde\".\n",
    "A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.\n",

    "*Example 1:* <br>\n",
    "Input: text1 = \"abcde\", text2 = \"ace\" <br> \n",
